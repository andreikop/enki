User manual
===========

About the manual
----------------
The best documentation - clear UI. We hope mksv3 has it.

This manual won't try to describe every button and menu. If you are having problems with copy-pasting text and navigation in the main menu, probably you don't need mksv3.

But, some topics still should be documented...

Files
-----

Create file
^^^^^^^^^^^
If mksv3 is executed from console with file names, it creates not existing files

Open file
^^^^^^^^^
Open file dialog usually opened in directory, where current file located.
If you want to open file from some directory, sometimes it's quicker to select in the opened file list
file from this directory, and only then press *Ctrl+O*

Sort opened file list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By default documents are sorted by URI. 
If you want to change sort order (i.e. sort by opening order or file name), rightclick a list item and go to *Sorting* menu.

You also can sort documents manually, by dran-n-dropping items in the list

Focus and navigation
--------------------
Few tips to minimize mouse usage during your standard workflow.

Docks
^^^^^
You can jump to any dock by pressing its shortcut. Press Esc when dock is focused to close it. Example:

* *F7,Esc* - close File browser

Press *Ctrl+Esc* to close all docks and search dialogue.

*Ctrl+Enter* moves focus back to current document.
