    # select the corresponding text in the preview pane. To do so, an approximate

    # text in the other pane provides the corresponding location in the other pane
    # to highlight.

    # #. I call ``toPlainText()`` several times. In the past, this was quite slow
    #    in a ``QTextEdit``. Check performance and possibly cache this value; it
    #    should be easy to update by adding a few lines to _setHtml().
    #
    # Preview-to-text sync
    ##--------------------
    # This functionaliy relies heavily on the Web to Qt bridge. Some helpful
    # references:
    #
    # * `The QtWebKit Bridge <http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qtwebkit-bridge.html>`_
    #   gives a helpful overview.
    # * `QWebView`_ is the top-level widget used to embed a Web page in a Qt
    #   application.
    #
    # For this sync, the first step is to find the single click's location in a
    # plain text rendering of the preview's web content. This is implemented in
    # JavaScript, which emits a Qt signal with the location on a click. A slot
    # connected to this signal then performs the approximate match and updates the
    # text pane's cursor. To do this:
    #
    # #. ``jsClick``, a PyQt signal with a single numeric argument (the index into
    #    a string containing the plain text rendering of the web page) is defined.
    #    This signal is :ref:`connected <onJavaScriptCleared.connect>` to the
    #    ``onWebviewClick`` slot.
    # #. The ``onJavaScriptCleared`` method inserts the JavaScript to listen for a
    #    click and then emit a signal giving the click's location.
    # #. The ``onWebviewClick`` method then performs the approximate match and
    #    updates the text pane's cursor location.
    # #. When a new web page is loaded, all JavaScript is lost and must be reinserted.
    #    The ``onJavaScriptCleared`` slot, connected to the
    #    ``javaScriptWindowObjectCleared`` signal, does this.

    # The job of this JavaScript handler is to
    # translate a mouse click into an index into the text rendering of the
    # webpage. To do this, we must:
    #
    # #. Get the current selection made by the mouse click, which is typically
    #    an empty range. (I assume a click and drag will produce a non-empty
    #    range; however this code still works).
    # #. Extend a copy of this range so that it begins at the start of the
    #    webpage and, of course, ends at the character nearest the mouse
    #    click.
    # #. Get a string rendering of this range.
    # #. Emit a signal with the length of this string.
    #
    # Note: A JavaScript development environment with this code is available
    # at http://jsfiddle.net/hgDwx/110/.
