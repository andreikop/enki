   The overall goal is to allow comments (everything but <pre> tags) to appear
   with normal (double) spacing, while comments and code are single spaced. In
   addition, this insures that a blockquote indent is one <pre> space, to allow
   comments and code to have identical horizontal alignment.

   The implementation:
   1. Fix the blockquote left margin to be one <pre> space; use no right margin. */

/* 2. Remove all top and bottom space around <pre>, making it single-spaced.
      Also, remove the border so that code and comments mix more
      naturally. */

/* 3. Remove the bottom margin around all elements, so they're only separated
      by a top margin.

      This is actually a bad thing: the spacing between dissimilar elements may
      not be correct. However, I can't find a CSS rule to modify the
      margins of elements which preceed code, so I just change them all. */

      next to code. Note that Sphinx encloses code in a
      <div class="highlight-language_name"> element.
