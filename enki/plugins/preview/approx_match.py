# The findApproxTextInTarget_ function in this module searches a target string
# for the best match to characters about an anchor point in a source string. In
# particular, it first locates a block of target text which forms the closest
# approximate match for source characters about the anchor. Then, it looks for
# the (almost) longest possible exact match between source characters about the
# anchor and the block of target text found in the first step.

    #   natural answer would be between ``a-`` and ``-b``. Therefore, we want to
    #   interpolate between the two target cursor anchors in this case.
    #
    # | Interesting case 2a:
    # |  searchText = Chapter 1:Once upon a time
    # |  targetText = :---------Once upon a time
    # |  searchAnchor: between ``Chapter 1:`` and ``Once upon a time``.
    # | The LCS in this case is ``:Once upon a time``. There are two mechanically
    #   value answers: an anchor to the right of the colon, or to the left of the
    #   O. We obviously want the anchor to the left of the O.

    #   valid answers: an anchor to the right of the e, or to the left of the
    #   comma. We obviously want the anchor to the right of the e.
    #
    # So, in these cases, prefer the side with the longest consectuive match.
    # Given the type of text we're matching (some ignorable markup mixed with
    # valid text), picking the valid text instead of interpolating seems best.
    #
    # Therefore, we need to find the targetText index of both sides of the match
    # (unless the match occurs at the beginning or end of the string). If both
    # sides of the match refer to the same anchor (i.e. rightIndex == leftIndex + 1),
    # then return the anchor between these to characters. Otherwise, return an
    # anchor based on which side has more characters in their portion of the lcs
