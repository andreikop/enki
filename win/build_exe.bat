:  Additional path to search for hook files.
:
: --runtime-hook=path-to-hook-file
: 	Specify a file with a custom runtime hook.

: ``bin\enki``
:   Enki entry point, from which Pyinstaller builds the application.
:
..\..\pyinstaller-git\pyinstaller.py --additional-hooks-dir=win --runtime-hook=win\pyi_rth_qt4plugins.py -y bin\enki
