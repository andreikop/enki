# Failing test casess
# -------------------
    # Scenario:
    #
    #   A click before the second ``head`` will bring the target anchor to
    #   the start of target text.
    #
    # Problem:
    #
    #   Since in search text, the chars inside ``<>`` denote a hyperlink,
    #   they will get deleted in target text. Clicking right before the
    #   second ``head`` should bring the target anchor to anywhere between
    #   ``head`` and ``tail``.
    #
    # Explanation:
    #
    #   The LCS algorithm find letters as close to the beginning of the string
    #   as possible. The X marks characters it chooses::
    #
    #     `head <http://head>`_ tail
    #              X      X       XX
    #
    #   It's found ``tail`` in parts of the hyperlink, so it places the target
    #   anchor between the found t and a at index 6.
    @unittest.expectedFailure
    def test_11(self):
        index = f(searchAnchor = 14,

    # Scenario:
    #
    #   A click between the second 'b' and second 'c' will bring the target
    #   anchor to the start of targetText.
    #
    # Problem:
    #
    #   More intuitive behavior would be placing the target anchor between
    #   ``ab`` and ``cd``.
    #
    # Explanation:
    #
    #   LCS again finds characters as close as possible to the beginning of the
    #   string. Again, X marks matched characters::
    #
    #     abcdabcdabcd
    #     XXXX

    #   places the found target anchor at the end of the string at index 4.
